# Password Generator

## Description
This project is a password generator. It has the user choose a password length and what character types they would like to see in their password. The password generator does have limits though, it must be at least 8 characteras and at most 128 characters and include at least one character type. This project was very challenging and there were a lot of aspects to this code i have never explored before, for example tracking character types based on the users choice, event listeners, and character randomization. The latter I was able to catch on quickly but some other aspects of this code i'm still working at comprehending. I learned a lot about working with mulitple arrays  and objects and I might even say I'm becoming a tad more familiar with functions,it all comes with practice so i will keep on going.

## Usage
To get started with the password generator you must click the 'generate password' button and follow the prompts. It will ask you how long you would like your password, if you would like special characters, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters. Once you follow through with the prompst it will provide your with your fully customized password.
